#### Just

[Just](https://github.com/casey/just) is a handy way to save and run project specific commands. Commands, called recipes, are stored in a file called `justfile` with syntax inspired by `make`. Recipes can be run with `just RECIPE`, and listed with `just --list`.

All of the commands needed for this project can be found and used from `justfile`. Despite being highly recommended, since Just is just a command wrapper it is not required to make this project work. Contents of the `justfile` can be used manually to standardize the commands.

```bash
# these are same
just clean
rm -rf build/

# clean recipe looks like this at the justfile
clean:
  rm -rf build/
```

### Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moon-aii/moonai.git
cd moonai
```

### Simulation

#### 1. Configure

```bash
just configure
cmake --preset linux-debug # manually
```

#### 2. Build

```bash
just build
cmake --build build/linux-debug --parallel # manually
```

| Command        | Description             |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| `just build`   | Debug build             |
| `just release` | Optimized release build |

##### CMake Options

| Option               | Default | Description      |
| -------------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| `MOONAI_BUILD_TESTS` | `ON`    | Build unit tests |

#### 3. Run

```bash
just run
```

Both `config.lua` and `settings.json` ship with the binary and are resolved from the binary directory.
